Here's what's cooking in the Swifty kitchen. Some of these are half-baked ideas, others are ready to go. Got a feature request? We're all ears!

## Recently Shipped

### Full Tutorial
A complete [step-by-step guide](/docs/tutorial) building a bakery brochure site from scratch, using every Swifty feature along the way.

### Live Reload
Dev server now auto-refreshes your browser when you save changes. No more manual refreshing!

### Incremental Builds
CSS, JS, and image changes now rebuild only what's needed. Full rebuilds only happen when pages, layouts, or partials change.

## On the Radar

### Pagination
For blogs with lots of posts, automatically split index pages. Set posts-per-page in config and let Swifty handle the rest.

### Search
Add search functionality to find pages across your site. Probably a simple client-side search using a generated JSON index.

### Templating Languages
Support for Liquid, Nunjucks, or similar templating for more complex logic in layouts.

### RSS Feeds
Auto-generate RSS/Atom feeds for blog sections.

### Sitemap Generation
Automatic sitemap.xml for better SEO.

## Maybe Someday

- **Drafts**: Pages that build locally but not in production
- **Scheduled posts**: Future-dated pages that only appear after their date
- **Image galleries**: Special handling for image-heavy pages
- **i18n support**: Multi-language sites with automatic linking

## Want Something?

If you've got ideas, bugs, or just want to say hi, open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/daz4126/swifty/issues). Swifty is built by people who use it, and your feedback shapes what comes next.
