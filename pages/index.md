## Create a Website in No Time!

Swifty is the super speedy static site generator that makes building a website a breeze. It uses convention over configuration to make building a website super easy. You just write all your content in MarkDown and then builds the whole site based on your folder structure with pretty urls and super fast navigation!

## Super Flexible

You can conditionally add layouts to pages as well as using partials for content that is created. Pages can dynamically insert data into the content using front matter notation or you can access data stored in separate JSON files. Embedded JavaScript can then be used to manipulate any of the page data and display it exactly how you want.
