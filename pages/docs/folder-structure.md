summary: How to structure folders
---

To keep your project organized, structure your files as follows:

/project-root
 ├── pages/        # Markdown content files
 ├── layouts/      # Layout templates
 ├── partials/     # Reusable content snippets
 ├── css/          # CSS stylesheets
 ├── js/           # JavaScript files
 ├── images/       # Static images
 ├── config.yaml   # Site configuration
 ├── templage.html # Main template file

Any pages placed inside a folder will become sub-pages of that folder. The path to these pages will reflect the folder structure.

So if there are two pages .

Order of Pages

Index Partials
