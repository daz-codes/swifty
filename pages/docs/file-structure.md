All pages go inside the "pages" folder.

Any folders inside here will create an index page named after the folder.

The urls of pages will follow the directory structure of the pages folder. So a page called "about.md" inside a folder called "blog" will have the url "/blog/about".

Even though the pages that are build have the `.html` file extension, this is **not** used in the url path.
