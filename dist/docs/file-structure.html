  <p>All pages go inside the &quot;pages&quot; folder.</p>
<p>Any folders inside here will create an index page named after the folder.</p>
<p>The urls of pages will follow the directory structure of the pages folder. So a page called &quot;about.md&quot; inside a folder called &quot;blog&quot; will have the url &quot;/blog/about&quot;.</p>
<p>Even though the pages that are build have the <code>.html</code> file extension, this is <strong>not</strong> used in the url path.</p>
