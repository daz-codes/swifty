  <p>Partials allow you to add small snippets of code into multiple pages.</p>
<p>They are perfect if you use the same chunk of code on multiple pages.</p>
<p>To include a partial, you need to add a markdown file to the &#39;partials folder&#39;. Then just include it using the following syntax:</p>
<pre><code>{{ partial: filename }}
</code></pre>
<p>You can even reference config variables inside a partial and it will display differently on different pages.</p>
